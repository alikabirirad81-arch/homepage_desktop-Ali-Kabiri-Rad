# Ali Kabiri Rad — Desktop Homepage

This is the **desktop version of the main homepage** for my personal resume website, designed to provide an optimal experience on larger screens.

## Features

- **Responsive desktop layout**: Designed for large screens while maintaining usability on smaller devices.
- **Dark/Light mode toggle**: Users can switch between dark and light themes.
- **Sidebar navigation**: Quick access to all sections from a fixed sidebar.
- **Project showcase**: Projects displayed in a grid with live links to Behance.
- **Animated skill bars**: Skills animate when scrolling into view.
- **Contact form**: Desktop-friendly contact form with placeholder alert for demo purposes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structure.
- **CSS3 & custom properties** for styling and theme management.
- **JavaScript** for interactions and animations.
- **Google Fonts (Poppins)** for typography.

## Design Decisions

- **Grid-based layout** for better organization of content on larger screens.
- **Cards and sections** to visually separate experiences, projects, and skills.
- **Gradient accents** to highlight important elements.
